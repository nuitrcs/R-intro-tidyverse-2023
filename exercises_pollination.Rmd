# Exercises: pollination

In the github repository for this workshop there is a .csv file with pollinator observation data. Read this in to RStudio using read_csv() and check out the column names and data using the code chunk below.

```{r}
pollination <- read_csv("pollination.csv")
names(pollination)
View(pollination)
```

## 

 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
